# hello-world
I am following a GitHub guide to learn about the art of making a repository.
Good morning, sir. I hope you are not reading this, but since it is public, you might be doing that.
I followed this guide from GitHub Guides and it told me to "write a bit about yourself," which I find a little creepy.
To counteract GitHub's evil intentions, I am not going to write about myself, so boom! Y'all ain't gonna get to my information!
Globalists! Stop putting chemicals in my water!
